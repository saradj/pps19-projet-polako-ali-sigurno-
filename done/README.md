 C Project Readme by Sara Djambazovska and Marouane jaakik

 1. Project Implementation

Throughout the project we encountered issues while testing using MakeFeedback. Other than that, we tried to provide clear,commented and well indented code. We regularly worked on the project and tried to cover everything in the weekly instruction provided.
2. Workload

We gradually felt the need to spend more time on the project, as the last weeks were more challenging and sometimes the instructions were hard to interpret. An estimated 10 hours/ week overall would be the time we spent working on the project, it could have been more without the help of the assistants during the practice hours.
